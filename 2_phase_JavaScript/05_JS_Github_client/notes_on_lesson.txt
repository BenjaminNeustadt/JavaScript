"callback" functions :
example of asynchronous behaviour

Another example : when we need to `fetch` remote
data from other APIs (Application Programming Interface)
because we need to wait before the data is available (the network
can be slow and unreliable), therefore we use callbacks.

E.G. Ruby's Sinatra Github repo, looking at the link in browser, can see only data (in the JSON format)

Humans like to browse nice/colorful webpages and use links/buttons/forms to interact with it. Porgrams don't need uch webpages,
they can just read and write raw data.

APIs are just a simpler way of interacting with a website like Github, but for programs, rather than humans.

USING the got package to send HTTP requests from JS program.
        - - - -

We create githubRequest.js file and write the code to fetch the data from the previous API, but the result we get
is hard to read as it is returned in JSON; so we can fix this by:

convert the tring data into a JavaScript object so it is formatted properly.
We can do this using JSON.parse:
                    - - - - - - -
following done in node:

`````````````````````````````````
Welcome to Node.js v18.4.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
> const stringValue = '{ "name": "John" }';
undefined
> stringValue
'{ "name": "John" }'
> const objectValue = JSON.parse(stringValue);
undefined
> console.log(objectValue);
{ name: 'John' }
undefined
> console.log(objectValue.name);
John
undefined
>
``````````````````````````````````


First exercise:

1. Modify code in githubRequest.js so that it converts
received response body to an object, using JSON.parse and prints it:

the function that does the logic is the function we
call callback function (i.e. setTimeout() the native function to JS,
but it takes another function to do its work, i.e. a function printmessage(), is an example of
a callback function, one that we give as an argument and it will be called back later when it needs to be
called back, whenever setTimeout() decides to call it back.)

E.G. Look at this:
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
const got = require('got');
// we require the package 'got'

const handleReceivedResponse = (response) => {
  const responseObject = JSON.parse(response.body);
  console.log(responseObject);
}
// this is the callback function, because it relies on being called by a second function below[is this right?]
got('https://api.github.com/repos/sinatra/sinatra').then(handleReceivedResponse);
