* In JavaScript, we can print to the terminal arbitrary strings and variables
  using console.log, like this:

```

// Just printing a literal string
console.log('Hello there');

// Declaring a new variable `age`
age = 25;

// We can concatenate strings with variables using the + operator
console.log('I am ' + age + 'years old');

// Assigning a new value
age = 27;
console.log('I am now ' + age + 'years old!');

```

* Can use the const keyword to declare a value as "constant",
  if we're not planning to change its value later â€” usually, 
  prefer using const if you don't need to reassign a variable, 
  as it can prevent a few different kind of errors in your programs 
  (it also communicates that this value won't need to change).

```
const name = 'Charlie';

name = 'Jess'; // will throw 'TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.'

```
