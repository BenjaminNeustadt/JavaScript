# Running JavaScript files

* We've only been running JavaScript inside our node REPL. Like other languages we can write JavaScript into source files
with the .js extension. We can run these files using node. 

Cf. hello.js file

* Every line of JavaScript ends with a semicolon (;). 
  Actually not specific to JS - other languages have similar syntax - but this is obviously different from Ruby.

  IN CASE YOU RUN INTO BUGS CHECK THERE ISNT A semicolon MISSING AT THE END OF THE LINE. 

  To save yourself the hassle of checking for missing semicolons, a tool like: 

  Prettier <https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html> 

  can help to automatically add them where they're needed (it also makes sure your code is properly formatted).

  To run it so it automatically formats JS files, you can run the following in any project directory: 

  ```  npx prettier --write . ```

  NOTE: If you don't want to overwrite files, but onlly check if they're properly formatted, 
  can use --check option instead of --write. 
  
  There's also a VSCode extension available:
