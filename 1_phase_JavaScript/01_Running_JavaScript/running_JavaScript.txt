# Running JavaScript

* You will need to install a program called Node.js (also just called "node").
  This is very similar to, for example, ruby or irb, which can read and execute Ruby code, either in files or entered directly into the REPL.
*
  First let's install nvm - the Node Version Manager. If you've used Ruby with rvm before, it's a   similar tool: nvm allows us to install and manage specific Node versions. 

  You'll need to run a command that looks like this:

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash`

  Once that step is complete, you'll need to reload your ~/.zshrc file:

`source ~/.zshrc`

  Now, you can install Node using nvm:

`$ nvm install node`
`$ nvm use node`
