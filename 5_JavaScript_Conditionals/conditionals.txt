# INTRO 

Conditionals work the same way as other languages, but we need:

Brackets () to enclose the condition.
Curly braces {} to enclose the code "body" executed following this condition.

# Exercise 

To complete the following, you will have to:

use if, else if and else to write conditionals.
use the strict equality operator === to compare values. SAME AS RUBY ==

Note: in all the following examples, we'll use the strict equality operator === 
(instead of ==), as it can prevent some bugs, and is viewed as one of the best practices
 in the JavaScript community. In your code, you should ideally use === as well when doing 
 comparisons (unless you have a good reason not to!).

Define a function getNumberSign that takes a number and returns either 'zero', 'positive' or 'negative' depending on its sign:
> getNumberSign(3);
'positive'

> getNumberSign(0);
'zero'

> getNumberSign(-5);
'negative'


# Exercise

A colleague just asked you some help to debug their code.

```
const isValidLength = (phoneNumber) => {
  const validLength = 10;
  if (phoneNumber.length == validLength) {
    true;
  } else {
    false;
  }
}

```
